The basic idea to tackle the problem statement was to implement social distancing in public places so we decided to develop an inline ticlet allocation system which would 
have a limited number of seats only allowed inside a bus , avoiding traffic congestion in a single route by applying shortest distance algorithm and also a ticket would be
considered valid only on verification of an image of user wearing a mask.

The detailed report on the project has been mentioned in the ZOHO writer as well as in "Report.docx" document present in this repository.
